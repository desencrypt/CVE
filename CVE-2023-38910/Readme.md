#### **Software Link**: [CSZ CMS](https://www.cszcms.com/)
#### **Version**: 1.3.0



**Description:** CSZ CMS 1.3.0 is affected by a cross-site scripting (XSS) feature that allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload entered in the 'Carousel Wiget' section and choosing our carousel widget created above, in 'Photo URL' and 'YouTube URL' plugin

### POC:


When logging into the panel, we will go to the "Carousel Widget" section and create a Carousel [http://localhost/admin/carousel]

We edit that Carousel that we have created and see that we can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the “Youtube URL” and “Photo URL” fields


We can inject HTML code
