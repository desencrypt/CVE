**Description:** CSZ CMS 1.3.0 is affected by a cross-site scripting (XSS) feature that allows attackers to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML via a crafted payload entered in the 'Social Settings' in which we can choose the field of any social network since that entry is affected by XSS.
The impact of this vulnerability is very high since it affects all the pages (since in all the pages there is a social network in the footer), apart from this vulnerability is visible from the outside without having to log in with any user.

When logging into the panel, we will go to the "Social Settings" section and  the vulnerable field is located at [http://localhost/admin/social]

We edit the link of any social network see that we can inject arbitrary web scripts or HTML into the “Profile Link”fields and activate it later.

We can inject code.

With the following payload we can achieve the XSS and as we see below, it affects all the pages since in all of them the social networks are in the footer.

```js
<div><p title="</div><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>">
```
